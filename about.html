In one sentence, I would describe myself as a normal human with abnormal thoughts that manifest as creativity. I am currently working toward degrees in Studio Arts and Graphic Design, and I have various professional and non-professional experience in both (you can view that stuff in my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>). 
I am currently a student at DePaul University in Chicago working toward degrees in Art, Media and Design with a concentration in Studio Arts, and a minor in Graphic Design. I have various professional and non-professional experience in both fields. One of my favorite experiences recently has been working with the Chicago Design Museum to create a mock catalogue, poster series, and brand identity for their <em>The State of Detroit</em> show. I also work as part of the creative team for a private gym, in which I design event schedules, promotional posters, flyers, and social media projects on a regular basis, all while getting mad gains. Other experience I have includes in t-shirt making, and snapchat geofilters!
