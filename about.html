I grew up in a multi-ethnic family and was exposed to diverse cultures through frequent travel to visit relatives and friends. Additionally, we housed many individuals or groups of people in our home, including refugees, international students, and others in need. My upbringing normalized differences in all aspects of life, so I am interested in how and why people have different worldviews and perspectives, and how much impact systems and environments have on a person’s identity. <br>

Influences for my work are primarily from personal experiences, such as my upbringing/my home or the idea of  “home” as it relates to identity. Much of my content is imagery directly from the house I grew up in or images that allude to ideas of home or identity. As a multiracial person/artist, I connect to work like that of Shoshanna Weinberger, who comments on the experience of being on the periphery of cultures and races as a multiracial/multicultural artist herself. She often employs multiples and grids in her work to support this theme of being a peripheral, almost anthropological observer, which I find compelling and notice parallels of in my pieces. Her work helped me understand the perspective I offer coming from a diverse upbringing and being ethnically/culturally mixed, and how other artists convey multiplicity and complex issues in their work. <br>

My work tends to be highly detailed and/or presented in a collection or series.  I often try to play the form and content off of each other to add layers of conceptual and stylistic interest, so I lean toward drawing and printmaking as they allow me to control the texture of marks, detail in content, and/or produce multiples. This stems from my interest in how the individual informs the whole and vice-versa. Some pieces, like Cup and Saucer (2016) or Butsudan (2014), offer a sense of privacy or preciousness, prompting the viewer to look closer at the unique details of individual objects. Other pieces, like Pantry at Home (2017) and Still Life Series (2014), focus on how individual parts fall into a collective, which prompts the viewer to consider the construction of the whole image and the significance of each mark or object within the whole. My overall goal is to have the viewer think of the construction and deconstruction of a whole by giving attention to each level of a piece, from individual marks and the shapes they form, to the combination of shapes that is the final image, to the collection or series that the final images fit into. <br>
