<p>Maya Sato is a Chicago-based artist, working primarily in drawing, printmaking, and design. She graduated from DePaul University with a BA in Studio Art. Her work is informed by exposure to a wide range of cultures and worldviews, and focuses on how parts inform a whole, and vice versa.

    Full Artist Statement:
  <p>I come from a multiracial family and had exposure to diverse cultures through visiting relatives and friends in different countries. Additionally, my family hosted a range of individuals and groups in our home, including refugees, international students, and others in need. My upbringing normalized differences in all aspects of life, so I am interested in how and why people have different worldviews and perspectives, and what informs them. <br>

Conceptually, I tend to draw from my childhood and the idea of “home” as it relates to identity, at a personal or global level. I am inspired by artists like Shoshanna Weinberger, who comments on the experience of being on the periphery of cultures and races as a multiracial artist herself. She often uses multiples and grids to convey the idea of observing, almost anthropologically, various identities of herself and others. I find this relatable as I often think about the construction and deconstruction of a whole, in part because I grew up with an awareness of the complexity of my own cultural/racial identity. This combined with regularly meeting people of different races, religions, cultures, languages, etc., conditioned me to expect and seek out complexities in ideas and identities of any kind. <br>

Aesthetically, my work involves lots of care and detail at the mark-making level, and often employs multiples. I work primarily in drawing and printmaking, as those media allow me to control texture, detail, and/or produce multiples. Most pieces are based on representation, either loosely or directly, of imagery related to my home and identity, or of trying to understand the identity and perspectives of others. Some pieces are more intimate in scale or perspective, prompting the viewer to look closer at how a feeling or idea is conveyed through mark-making or color. Others offer a wider focus, with many discernable parts creating a larger image or collection, prompting the viewer to consider the construction and deconstruction of the whole. My overarching goal is to give viewers something to notice and think about at multiple levels of a piece, in hopes that they make a habit of seeking out and trying to understand complexities in themselves and others. <br>
