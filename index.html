I grew up in a multi-ethnic family and was exposed to diverse cultures through frequent travel to visit relatives and friends, along with housing many individuals or groups of people in our home, including refugees, international students, and others in need. My upbringing normalized differences in all aspects of life, so I am interested in how and why people have different ways of thinking or seeing the world, and how much influence systems and environments have on a person’s identity versus their own nature. <br>
	
In 2015 I interviewed multiracial artist Shoshanna Weinberger about her work and influences, and was inspired by the rich historical and philosophical foundation for her pieces. Learning of the  multiple layers of conceptual depth behind the aesthetic appeal of her work furthered my  interested in making pieces that attract and engage a wide audience while subtly conveying a deeper meaning or message. <br>

The Butsudan (2015) series is perhaps the most personal piece I’ve made so far, drawing from my cultural background and significant objects from my childhood. The still-life presents a homemade Buddhist altar, Butsudan, a familiar item from my family's homes in Japan, using found objects from my home in Skokie. The objects are arranged as a traditional Butsudan, and each item has a significance to my family,  but none are of Japanese origin. In hopes of continuing to validate and accept cultural diversity in the way I experienced it, I combined these items as a simple still-life to give an intimate, accessible look into a “home” that can be at once culturally rich and culturally subversive. <br>
